MaCH - Matrices in CHISEL
=======================

!!WIP!!

Chisel library that provides a `Matrix` type, and defines operators, init functions & helper methods for said Matrix type
Essentially just a wrapper around a 2D vector.


## TODO
- Develop regression
- General clean up of code (refactor some methods which have similar logic)
- Look into extending `VecLike`, so matrix types have access to all methods Vec does, without neccesarily having to redefine these methods (definition of an implicit might make this very easy).
